We always use sc_Camera.position in the fragment shader, which forces precision of all members to mediump. Once we attempt to use sc_Camera.clipPlanes in the vertex shader, it creates highp uniforms for all members, which conflict with the mediump uniforms from the fragment shader. This means that even the "aspect" member conflicts with itself, even though it's not used at all, neither in vs nor fs. The solution is to force all members to fragment precision.
